 *  In order to implicitly maintain the convensions of Clarkson.compgeo93,
 *  we will order the vertices and facets of the simplex such that the i'th
 *  facet is opposite the i'th vertex (using the definition of clarkson), and
 *  thus is defined by the d vertices
 *  excluding the i'th. In addition, the i'th neighbor is the neighbor sharing
 *  the i'th facet and opposite the i'th vertex.
 *
 *  By the uniformity conventions of Clarkson.compgeo93, we'll reserve the
 *  0 index for the 'peak' vertex, and the 'base' facet
 *
 *  Because the 0'th vertex is the 'peak' vertex and the 'peak' vertex of
 *  a boundary simplex in the extended triangulation is the anti origin, the
 *  address stored in vertices[0] will be equal to the address of
 *  Triangulation::origin for the triangulation which owns this simplex.
 *
 *  The simplex also stores a normal vector \p n and an offset \p c defining
 *  a linear inequality whose hyperplane is coincident to the 'base' facet and
 *  oriented such that n' x < c is the half-space containing the 'peak' vertex
